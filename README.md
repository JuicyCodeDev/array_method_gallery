# array_method_gallery

My interpretation of Wes Bos's Javascript30 project No. 5: "Flex Panels Image Gallery" that you can find here: 

https://javascript30.com/

It's a flex panel gallery that provides explantions for the following array methods:

.filter()

.sort()

.map()

.reduce()

.flat()

This little project helped me to learn about flex panels as well as to review the listed array methods at the same time :)

I hope the explanations can help you to consolidate your understanding of the methods as well.
